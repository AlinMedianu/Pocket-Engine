# Pocket-Engine
This is the C++/DirectX/Assimp engine I mentioned in my CV. As I said in there, this is meant to showcase everything I've learned about C++. It is meant to be an ever increasing collection of algorithms, patterns and techniques that could be reused in any future games I will be taking part of. Pocket Engine is "the big one" and as such, while developing it, I will explore or re-explore topics like, but not limited to, multithreading, the DirectX graphics pipeline (with all of its 10 stages), the DirectX compute pipeline, XAudio2, networking, memory owners (or "smart pointers"), event systems and data visualization systems (or debug systems).
